    Warden is online hosts manager and warden for intranet.
    Warden allows you to monitor events when intranet hosts goes online
    or offline and execute any external commands on these events. For instance,
    you can turn off your router when whole intranet goes to sleep.

    service by yourself.

    But the best way is to build Debian package and use systemd to manage
    warden daemon.
